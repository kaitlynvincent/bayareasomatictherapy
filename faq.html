        <p>
          We know it can take courage to reach out. Here are answers to some of the most common questions we receive.
          If you don’t see your question here, feel free to contact us.

        <h2>Do you take insurance?</h2>
        <p>
          At this time, we do not bill insurance directly. We offer a sliding scale and low-fee group therapy
          as part of our nonprofit mission. If you need a superbill to submit for possible reimbursement,
          you can ask us during your consultation.
        </p>

        <h2>What is somatic therapy?</h2>
        <p>
          Somatic therapy is a body-based approach that supports healing through the mind–body connection.
          We pay attention to sensation, emotion, impulses, and protective patterns — not to force anything,
          but to gently build safety, capacity, and choice in your nervous system.
        </p>

        <h2>Is this for CPTSD?</h2>
        <p>
          Many people who find us resonate with CPTSD, developmental trauma, attachment wounds, or chronic stress.
          Our approach is trauma-informed and paced carefully. You don’t need a specific diagnosis to benefit —
          you deserve support if life has been too much for too long.
        </p>

        <h2>How do groups work?</h2>
        <p>
          Our groups are structured, supportive, and trauma-informed. You’ll receive clear group agreements,
          weekly themes, and a steady rhythm. Group therapy often includes nervous system skills, resourcing,
          reflection, and optional sharing — without pressure.
        </p>

        <h2>What if I’m not sure I belong?</h2>
        <p>
          That feeling is incredibly common, especially for trauma survivors. We encourage you to start with
          a free 15-minute consultation. We can explore fit and help you decide whether individual therapy,
          group therapy, or another support option is best for you right now.
        </p>

        <h2>What does sliding scale mean?</h2>
        <p>
          Sliding scale means we offer a range of fees based on income and financial access.
          Our sliding scale for individual therapy is <strong>$120–$180/session</strong>.
          We aim to find a number that is sustainable for you and for our nonprofit program.
        </p>

        <hr class="sep" />

        <h2>How do I get started?</h2>
        <p>
          The next step is to send us a message. We’ll respond within 1–2 business days and help you schedule
          a free 15-minute consultation or join a group waitlist.
